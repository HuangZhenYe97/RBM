# Code for analysing RBM
This repository contains codes of differnt algorithms of RBM. The code is in python and most of them are shown in jupyter notebook.
  
## Statistic mechanics of RBM
RBM is a kind of energy based model and it can complete some unsupervised learning task. Gernerally, maximizing log-likelihood is used to train RBM. However, computing the free-energy or the thermal average term of a RBM require O(2^{N+M}) time complexity.
